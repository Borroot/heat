\section{Sequential}
The following improvements have been made to the sequential version of the relaxtion algorithm.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Combined relaxation and stability check into one loop.
    \item Check for malloc failure.
\end{itemize}
N, EPS and HEAT can be passed as arguments to the program for easy testing.

\section{openMP}
Do not use reduction, because then the other threads will still calculate \texttt{fabs(out[i] - in[i]) <= eps}, while this is no longer needed. Use openMP's support for for-loops in the \texttt{init} and \texttt{relaxAndStable} functions.
