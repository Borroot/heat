\section{Sequential}
Improvements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Combined relaxation and stability check into one loop
    \item Check for malloc failure
\end{itemize}
N, EPS and HEAT can be passed as arguments to the program.
\section{openMP}
Use no reduction, because then the other threads will still calculate \texttt{fabs(out[i] - in[i]) <= eps}, while this is no longer needed.
Use of openMP's support for for-loops in \verb init  and \verb relaxAndStable .
\section{MPI}

\section{Performance}
